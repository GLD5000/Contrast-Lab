# GLD Contrast Tool

## Create Accessible Colour Combinations

### Quickly compare any number of colours and ensure that they meet current standards for visual Contrast Ratios and accessibility (WCAG 2.1).

[Read a brief summary of the Contrast Ratio Guidance on GLD DevTips](https://glddevtips.web.app/?title=WCAG%202.1%20Contrast%20Guidance).

- Add existing colours in any common format (RGB, Hexadecimal or HSL)
- Batch import colours (with names) from your favourite IDE or a spreasheet
- Experiment with different combinations using the Colour Picker, HSL sliders or Text Box to easily modify or create new colours
- Use the 'Match' button to match the relative luminance of two different colours
- Adjust the hue or saturation of a colour and the luminance will be automatically adjust to keep the brightness stable

For each colour you add you can see:

- Contrast against black and white
- Relative Luminance (a definitive measure of brightness used to calculate contrast ratios)
- Contrast Ratios with every other colour added.
- Colour Space conversions in HSL, RGB and Hexadecimal.

When you are happy with your modified colour scheme, you can export it with the click of a button to the following formats:

- Tailwind for use in the 'tailwind.config.js' configuration file as Custom Colours
- CSS for use as Custom Properties
- SCSS for use as Property Declarations
- Sass for use as Property Declarations
- TSV (Tab Separated Values) for use in a spreadsheet.
